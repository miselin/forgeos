Use the uEnv.txt in this directory instead of the existing uEnv.txt to force
u-boot to boot via Kermit.

To test for the beagleboard, ensure an SD card configured for the BeagleBoard is
inserted in the board, with the uEnv.txt from this directory in it.

Restart the BeagleBoard - it will automatically hang waiting for the kermit
transmission to start.

Run the 'kermit.sh' script; this will transmit the kernel image via the serial
line, and then run minicom to allow you to see the output from the kernel.

Alternatively, 'make kermit' will do this too.

Ensure that minicom's default configuration is set up for the serial line before
running the kermit.sh script. You should also change kermit.cmd if your serial
port is not /dev/ttyUSB0.
