Mattise: a new operating system
===============================

Compiling
=========

You'll need to have an i586-elf cross-compiler available to build Mattise.

You'll also need 'clang', 'cppcheck', and 'mkisofs' installed.

If one does not exist, create a 'make.config' file with the following
contents:

XCOMPILER_PREFIX := /path/to/your/cross/compiler/bin
XCOMPILER_TARGET := {i[3456]86, arm, ppc}

This just makes sure the build system knows where everything is on your
particular system.

Once everything's set up, just type:

make

And the compilation will begin.

Running
=======

Just boot the 'mattise.iso' disc image in the 'build' directory.

For your convenience, a script to run QEMU is provided in the 'scripts'
directory.
