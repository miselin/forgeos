* Timer API that allows for automatically selecting the best timer for given
  semantics. For example, using the HPET for a one-shot alarm, and the RTC
  for very-high-resolution timing.
* API for interrupts that can make use of the features of more advanced
  interrupt controllers seamlessly.
* ARM, x64, x86 ports with feature parity.
* Clean POSIX support, with either a custom or otherwise sane libc.
* Hand-written POSIX headers rather than those provided by somebody else.
* Native drivers (ie, no CDI or UDI)
* CDI layer on top of native driver layer to allow loading of CDI drivers
* Support for ring3 drivers
* Fast IPC!
* An awesome build system. One-command builds, easy target selection, buildbot
  integration.
* Fun project stuff like nightlies!
* Regularish releases
